# Waste Classification

🧩 Problem Statement

Waste mismanagement has become one of the most critical environmental challenges in modern urban areas. Every day, tons of waste are generated from households, industries, and commercial sectors, much of which is improperly segregated. Manual waste sorting is not only labor-intensive and inefficient but also poses serious health risks to workers. Improper segregation leads to recyclable materials being dumped in landfills and organic waste being mixed with non-biodegradable items, causing severe environmental pollution and resource loss.

To address this issue, there is a strong need for an automated, intelligent, and scalable waste classification system that can accurately identify and categorize waste into organic and recyclable types. Leveraging the power of Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this project aims to develop a Smart Waste Classification System capable of analyzing images of waste materials and classifying them in real-time. The model utilizes Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2 to achieve high accuracy with reduced computational cost. Such a system can be integrated into IoT-based smart bins, municipal waste management systems, or mobile applications, helping to promote cleaner cities, improve recycling efficiency, and support sustainable environmental practices.
